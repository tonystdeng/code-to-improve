# Code To Improve .V1.0

## Project Explanation

This app records your keyboard activity, and analysis your working habit based on it. 

It is meant for a tool to help you improve your working habit by learning more about it yourself, and make you more productive.

**Note: This app is meant to analysis large data, for pure testing purposes, please use the pre-recorded files in `recordings-example` folder.**

With little to non data, the app will reject to analysis, and have a decent chance of behave unexpectedly or even produce unhandled error.

## How to use

In `settings.json`, set the folder you want to store the saved files of your recored working log.

Then make sure the `settings.json` is in the same folder as the executable, and simply run the executable.

**Note**, the executable is linux only, if you are on other OS, please run the app in other ways.

**Run by source code**

- Have `python3.4~12` installed.

- Use command `pip install pynput` to install `pynput` for keyboard monitoring.

- Run `main.py` with python.

Then just follow the instructions in the app.
